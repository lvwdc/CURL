THIS IS CURL. A simple URL 404 checker... with another feature.
By entering a url into the text box of CURL, for example, www.example.com/helloworld7545, you can create variations of this url, to discover different webpages. 
Simply enter the # of characters you want to replace at the end of the url for example 2. This means that the program will replace the "45" in the url with
randomly generated 2 digit numbers - or letters.
You can also press for the "check for 404 errors" button to find if there is a webpage for the randomly generated url.
